fastq-filter
============

Yet another fastq filtering programYet another FastQ filtering program.

Started out of frustration because the Biopython script that implemented a
paired-end filtering scripts as decribed in EMIRGE was terribly slow. Wanted
to learn how to use Heng Li's kseq and needed a refresher on argtable, so I
started this.

kseq was downloaded from http://lh3lh3.users.sourceforge.net/download/kseq.tar.bz2
