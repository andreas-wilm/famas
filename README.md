fastq-filter
============

Yet another Fastq filtering program

Started out of frustration because the Biopython script that
implemented a paired-end filtering scripts was terribly slow. Besides,
I wanted to learn how to use Heng Li's kseq.h and needed a refresher
on argtable, so I started this little project.

You will need libz and libargtable2 installed on your system for
compilation.
