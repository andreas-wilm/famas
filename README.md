fastq-filter
============

Yet another fastq filtering programYet another FastQ filtering program.

Started out of frustration because the Biopython script that
implemented a paired-end filtering scripts was terribly slow. Besides,
I wanted to learn how to use Heng Li's kseq.h and needed a refresher
on argtable, so I started this little project.
